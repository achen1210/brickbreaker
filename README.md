Readme File for Brick Breaker game in Java.
Last Updated 11/21/22.

This is a brick breaker game to I created to refresh Java skills and learn about Java Swing package. Updated and improved when time allows. 

To play, simply download the .jar file and run it (Should work with Java JRE 7+, but I have only tested with Java 19).

Current next steps:
*Add user input feature to control ball speed, number of bricks, etc.
*Add additional features like multiple balls, special bricks, etc.
